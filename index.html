                        I’m a full-stack developer, data engineer, and startup founder passionate about building scalable, user-driven platforms. With hands-on expertise in FastAPI, React Native, MongoDB, and AWS, I bring strong backend architecture, mobile development, and cloud deployment experience.

                        As the Founder & Sole Developer of Rivalarc, a competitive social media platform for video-based faceoffs, I led the entire product journey — from architecture and development to team building and public launch. Alongside, I’ve held technical and project management roles, optimizing NLP pipelines, automating data workflows, and managing multi-disciplinary teams.

                        I thrive in high-impact environments where creativity, engineering, and product vision intersect. My work spans end-to-end platform development, machine learning integration, and growth-driven tech leadership.

At the end of this internship, as a final project, I developed a machine learning model to predict the death rate of a cancer patient. This project is wholly based on numeric data input where the values are generated from the scanned reports of the person who tested for cancer. The dataset was retrieved from an online source. The regression model predicts whether the patient is detected with cancer with the regression model.</p>
