At the end of this internship, as a final project, I developed a machine learning model to predict the death rate of a cancer patient. This project is wholly based on numeric data input where the values are generated from the scanned reports of the person who tested for cancer. The dataset was retrieved from an online source. The regression model predicts whether the patient is detected with cancer with the regression model.</p>
